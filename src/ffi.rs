// Thread-safety markers
// Safety rationale:
// - CCH (CustomizableContractionHierarchy) after construction is immutable.
// - CCHMetric after successful customize() is read-only for queries; underlying RoutingKit code
//   does not mutate metric during query operations (queries keep their own state).
// - CCHQuery holds mutable per-query state and must not be shared across threads concurrently;
//   we allow moving it between threads (Send) but not Sync.
// If RoutingKit later introduces internal mutation or lazy caching inside CCHMetric, these impls
// would need re-audit.
